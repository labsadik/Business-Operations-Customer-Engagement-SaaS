# Conventus

Conventus is a multi-tenant scheduling SaaS for companies that want customers to request live meetings and have the system automatically route each request to an available employee.

## Product model

- **Company** creates a workspace and a public booking page.
- **Employee** connects Google and participates in availability/routing.
- **Customer** opens the company's public page, signs in with Google, selects a date/time/duration, and sends a request.
- **Assignment engine** offers the request to eligible employees with a five-minute acceptance window.
- **Meeting engine** creates the Google Meet space and Calendar event after an employee accepts.
- **Meeting route** is company-scoped, for example `/acme/meet/abc123` (canonical public-company meeting route).

## Plans

| Plan | Price | Employees | Meetings / month | Max duration | Concurrent meetings |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Starter | ₹99/month | 10 | 100 | 20 min | 10 |
| Business | ₹199/month | 30 | 350 | 35 min | 30 |

## Architecture principles

- MongoDB is the source of truth.
- Redis is for low-latency coordination, cache, locks, and rate limiting.
- Google OAuth is used for identity and delegated Calendar/Meet access.
- Booking state changes are server authoritative.
- Acceptance and meeting creation are idempotent.
- Tenant isolation is enforced at the application/data-access layer.
- Background work is durable and retryable rather than held open in request handlers.
- Public booking and internal company/employee experiences are separated by route and authorization boundary.

## Development

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Set MongoDB and Redis credentials.
3. Configure the Google Cloud project and OAuth credentials.
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
5. Run `npm run dev`.

## Checks

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run check`

## Delivery phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation
Application shell, landing page, route boundaries, plan entitlements, database/Redis configuration, security defaults, health endpoint, and documentation.

### Phase 2 — Identity and tenancy
Google OAuth, users, companies, workspaces, memberships, roles, secure OAuth token storage, onboarding.

### Phase 3 — Scheduling
Availability rules, Google Calendar free/busy, meeting types, public booking, five-minute request state machine, routing and concurrency protection.

### Phase 4 — Meetings
Google Meet creation, Calendar event creation, realtime confirmation, company-scoped `/meet/[meetingId]`, supported Meet embedding/meeting surface.

### Phase 5 — Billing and operations
Subscriptions, usage enforcement, notifications, admin operations, audit logs, monitoring, retries, rate limiting, and production hardening.

### Phase 6 — Scale
Queue tuning, Redis upgrade when required, database scaling, caching, load testing, SLOs, observability, and disaster recovery.

## Billing with Razorpay

Conventus connects the existing Starter (₹99/month) and Business (₹199/month) plan entitlements to Razorpay Checkout. The server creates the Razorpay order from the trusted plan definition, validates the returned signature, confirms the payment is captured, and then activates the paid plan for one month. Razorpay webhook events are also accepted at `/api/webhooks/razorpay` for server-side reconciliation. Razorpay recommends server-side order creation, signature validation, payment-status verification, and HMAC validation for webhooks. citeturn731333search0turn318613search5

Required environment variables:

```
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

For local development use Razorpay Test Mode credentials. For production/Vercel, configure the Live Mode credentials in the Vercel environment settings and configure the Razorpay webhook URL as:

`https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/webhooks/razorpay`

Never commit the secret values.

## Security

Never commit secrets. Google refresh tokens, application secrets, Redis credentials, database credentials, billing secrets, and email provider keys must stay server-side.
